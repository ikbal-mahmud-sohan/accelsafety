Responsibilities

HSE Manager

From the manufacturer/supplier at the time of purchase, proof load test certificates of a forklift or other powered vehicles are to be obtained. This should be retained by Engineering / Maintenance manager and should be readily available by HSE manager or any other person who has the authority to verify the certificate.
Ensure that training programs are being organized following the “Training and Development” procedure (Ref: BSRM-MP-08) for operators of forklift trucks and other such powered vehicles by the engineering department.
Keep records of such training and dates of any refresher courses required.

Vehicle Operators

The vehicle must be withdrawn from service immediately and defect reported immediately to the responsible supervisor, should the defect have the potential to affect personnel or equipment safety.   
Operate the equipment according to the manufacturers’ instructions
Do not use the vehicle for any other purposes other than those it was designed for.
To ensure that the vehicle is safe and free from defects, check the mobile equipment before and after use. Report any defects to the responsible supervisor and raise a work order through the maintenance management program. 
If the defects are minor and do not affect the safety of personnel/equipment, then such equipment may be used and repairs affected later.

Maintenance Department

In the maintenance management program and equipment maintenance log, records are to be maintained and updated.
For the testing and examination of lifting equipment, the Maintenance Manager will arrange a private agency, recognized by local government or international regulating agency, to carry out periodic load tests and examination of such vehicles.
Maintain forklift and other powered vehicles in a serviceable condition and incorporate safety checks in the planned preventive maintenance schedule.



5.0 Procedure:

 5.1 Safe Working Practices:

Any operator who violates plant or traffic safety rules or operates a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or drugs shall face disciplinary actions. 
Unless they are trained and competent to operate the machine and possess the required driving license, no employee shall operate vehicles.
All operators of company vehicles or a personal vehicle on company business shall follow the statutory road traffic regulations and shall wear the vehicle’s safety belt system at all times of operation.



5.2 Training of Vehicle Operators

Power vehicle operators require training. The training of the designated operators should include:

Basic training - Basic training should cover fully the skills and knowledge required for the safe operation of the type of forklift.

On Job Training (OJT) shall include instruction on familiarization of the workplace, instruction on any special needs and gaining practical experience in the handling of any special attachments and should be carried out under the close supervision of the training supervisor.

Training should cover the various applications that the vehicle is designed to perform under normal and abnormal working conditions.



5.3 Forklift Truck Guidelines

Forklift trucks are designed for one-man operation. It should not carry any passengers. Exceptions to this are when the forklift truck has been specifically designed to incorporate man lift equipment as an option.  
No horseplay will be tolerated.
 

5.3.1 Raising Loads

When lifting load, it is important to remember the following points:

Keep the center of gravity of the load as close to the mast as possible. Be sure that loads are carried against the mast and not on the ends of the forks. Also ensure that the mast is tilted backwards and the forks are raised no higher than necessary for floor clearance to keep a low center of gravity.  
Start the truck (other than battery-electric) in neutral with the parking brake set.
Off-centered loads should be strapped to the mast.
All loose loads must be carried on pallets and never on bare forks.
No one should pass under the forks or attachments.
Don’t lift the load with only one fork.
No loads should be heavier than the rated capacity.
 vertical load backrest extension is required for high loads.



5.3.2  Lowering Loads

When setting down the load using a forklift, it is important to remember these points:

Travel uphill / downhill with load leading.
Travel with load trailing except when going uphill, if load obscures vision.
The forklift should not be driven, nor turned, with the forks raised.
Do not break too sharply when the load is being transferred.
Drive slowly on rough roads.
A spotter or fork-height attendant may be required when working in close racks.
Where the load could fall, keep assistants and other pedestrians out of the area.
Never place a load in an aisle or block a stairway, fire equipment or a fire aisle.
Exercise caution with an elevated load after checking overhead clearance.  Until it is on the floor or top of the stack, do not tilt the load forward.
Loads must be approached squarely.
Operate the hydraulic controls smoothly.
